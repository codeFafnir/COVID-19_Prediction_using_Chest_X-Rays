# COVID-19_Prediction_using_Chest_X-Rays
Prediction of COVID-19 form the patient's chest X-Ray
In this project I have used Keras Sequential API to create a CNN based model which has 17 layers and 2.7 Million parameters to be learned. In near future I plan to inlcude
and visualize the region where we need to look so as to detect the COVID-19 infection.
